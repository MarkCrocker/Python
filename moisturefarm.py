Uncle Owen is a moisture farmer on a desert planet in a galaxy far, far away. As part of his job, he often needs to hire droids from the local market to help him in his farming tasks. Owen’s current needs require him to hire exactly ten droids per week, but the cost of the droids fluctuates from week to week. Write a program to help Owen keep track of some statistics about his droids on any given week.This program should take in 10 inputs representing the prices of droids. The program should writethe 10 pricesfor this week to afile(in append mode), along with the total costof droidsfor the week, and the average cost per droid this week. Remember, we can calculate the average of a group of numbers by adding up all thenumbers anddividing the total by the number of numbers. In this case, it’d be the total cost of the droids, divided by 10. As a bonus on top of this bonus problem, extend your program to take in any number of droid prices, in case Owen ever expands his business. If you do this optional extension, post both versions of the code on teams, the one with the fixed number of inputs, and the one with an uncertain number of inputs.
