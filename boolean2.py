Museum Price Challenge 

The problem statement is as follows. Let's assume that we have a museum that has the following 
policy for the admission price based on a full price ticket of $12.50. 
The museum is closed on Mondays. Everyone gets half price discount on Tuesday and Thursdays. 
If you are age between 13 and 20 (including min-max), you will get the discount on Wednesdays. 
If you are younger than 6, or older than 65, your admission if free. 
If you are age between 6 and 12 (including min-max), your admission is half price on the 
Weekend (Saturday and Sunday). Build the program that gives the user to input the day of the week 
and his/her age, then gives the user information about the pricing for him/her. Your program should 
only have three patterns of output 1.) "We are closed on Monday," 2.) "You get half price discount of 
$99.99!", 3.) "You pay full price pf $99.99." Test your program with multiple days and multiple ages â€“ 
before you run the program, determine what the answer should be to check for accuracy. 

BONUS: rather than input the day of the week, use date functions to try and determine what the day of the 
week is based on the current system date.
